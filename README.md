This github repository includes zip files of projects I have completed during my education at the University of Delaware.
Projects have their own README's for more details about how to run. 

Primarily the projects are from my cybersecurity classes and pertain to making secure software which can be run through either hosting
websites or just running c-programs. 

See other readme's for more details on each project
